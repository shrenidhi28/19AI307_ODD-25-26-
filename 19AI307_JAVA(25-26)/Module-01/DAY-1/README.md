# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## QUESTION:


## AIM: To write and execute a Java program that displays the message "Hey, my first java program!" using the output state


## ALGORITHM :
1.Start the program.

2.Open a text editor or IDE and create a new Java file named FirstProgram.java.

3.Define a public class named FirstProgram.

4.Inside the class, define the main() method, which acts as the entry point of the program.

5.Use the System.out.println() statement to print "Hey, my first java program!" on the screen.

6.Save, compile, and run the program; then stop the execution.



## PROGRAM:
 ```
